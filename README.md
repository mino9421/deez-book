This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What the purpose of this project?

I wanted to give [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) a shot by trying it out. I went over the documentatiosn and watched the Author's video (Theo) 3 hours video. I was able to complete this 3 hours guide within 2 days.
I learned about new services to solve certain problems I am facing with my main project.

Listed below the different technologies I had to use to get this app to this stage of completion.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - The frontend that T3 is built on top aka React
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Flexible CSS "class library" that provide nice styling
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io) - An ORM tool that interacts with our database
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) - This was the newest and most unique concept of this project. It is essentially a GraphQL replacement that provide client-server communication between services and components and there are more to it I need to learn.
- [Axiom](https://axiom.co/) - Tracking data
- [Clerik](https://clerk.com/) - Authentication easy straight forward tool a must use
